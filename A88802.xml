            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 70 -->from utter ruine; now ſo ſtrongly and openly Labored by the two factions of Presbytery, and Independency, and ſuch as have beene bewitched, and beſotted, by thoſe bloody and viperous Traytors.</p>
               <p>For what is there almoſt in this Covenant, which was not for ſubſtance, either expreſſed, or manifeſtly included, in that ſolemn Proteſtation, of <hi>May</hi> the fifth 1641. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole Kingdome ſtands ingaged, untill this day: The ſinfull neglect whereof, (as wee may juſtly feare) opens one Flud-gate the more, to let in all theſe Calamities, upon the Kingdome, and caſt upon it, a neceſſity of renuing Covenant, and entring into this.</p>
               <p>And if it bee ſaid the extirpation of Presbytery (which hath not ſo much as the face of a Law to countenance it, nor any colour to introduce it in this Kingdome but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſcandalous petitions preferred to the Parliaments in Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> His time, by factious and ſeditious perſons, that neither feared God nor his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, but were wholy adicted to change, and who by the wiſdomes of thoſe Parliaments received their juſt rewards) is unwarrantable, or not neceſſary: The aſſertors thereof will not onely appeare to bee defective in their own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but lay an aſperſion upon the wiſdome and temper of the Parliaments of thoſe times, by the moderation and Juſtice whereof under God wee reaped thoſe bleſſings of Peace, and Plenty, which wee injoyed, untill wee were deprived thereof, by the induſtrious malice of theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformers.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe Clegy-men and others, who may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they cannot Covenant, to extirpate that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which themſelves have ſworne to ſet up. They can tell if they pleaſe, that they that have ſworne obedience to the Lawes of the Land, are not by any voluntary, or inforced oath, or Covenant, to bee after taken, bound to extirpate thoſe Lawes, though they bee inconvenient. And if any Miniſter, or others, have entred into any ſuch oath,

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 71 -->or Covenant, not warranted by the Lawes of God, and the Land: In this caſe they muſt teach themſelves; and others, that ſuch oathes call for repentance, not pertinacy therein.</p>
               <p>That ſcruple, that this is done without the Kings conſent will ſoone bee removed, if it bee remembred that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the fifth of <hi>May</hi> before mentioned, was voted and executed by both Houſes, and after by order of one houſe ſent abroade, to all the Kingdome: His Majeſtie not excepting againſt it, or giving any ſtop to the taking of it, all be it he was then reſident in perſon at <hi>White-Hall:</hi> But now, his Majeſty being impriſoned, and it being voted, that no addreſſe ſhall bee made unto him; the People are diſcharged before God and Man, if of themſelves, they enter into a Covenant to reſtore this Religion, and to free their Soveraigne, themſelves, and their poſterities, from Tyranny and Slavery.</p>
               <p>Therefore however ſome men, hoodwinckt; and blinded, by the Artifices, of theſe Jeſuiticall Engineeres; who have long conſpired, to Sacrifice our Religion, Lawes, Liberties and perſons to Arbitrary ſlavery; and our Eſtates to their inſatiable avarice; may poſſibly bee deterred, and amuſed, with high threats and Declarations, flying up and downe upon the wings of the Priviledge, and power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (now captivated and proſtituted to ſerve all their luſts) to proclaime all Malignants, Incendiaries, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State, who take This Covenant. Yet let no faithfull Engliſh heart be afraid to joyne with their loyall fellow Subjects of the three Kingdomes, in this Solemne Lawfull League.</p>
               <p>What though thoſe tongues ſet on fire by hell doe raile and threaten: That God who but even as yeſterday vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to diſperſe thoſe darke Clouds, and Foggs, which overſhaddowed the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made their Loyalty appeare as cleere as the Sunne at noone day, in the very eyes of their purblinde brethren. And hath ſo

               <p>READER, I deſire thee to compare this Covenant, and the exhortation for the taking thereof, with that, which was with ſuch violence impoſed upon theſe Nations, in the yeare 1643. (and is now againe threatned) and thou ſhalt finde, the reaſons heere given, to bee really the ſame, that were then pretended, for the obtruding that upon us, But the legallity and neceſſity of this, to bee ſo great and juſt: That it needed no reaſons to perſwade any man to enter into it but if yet thou wanteſt reaſon: Reade over a booke lately printed intituled <hi>Good Engliſh:</hi> and if that give thee not ſatisfaction, that there can be no ſetled Peace but this way, I ſhall conclude that thou art willfully blinde or deperately wicked to thine own deſtruction.</p>
